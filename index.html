          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past three decades, Wendy Schamaun has combined advanced education, military
            service, and mission-driven leadership to support global high-threat and risk assessment
            efforts for the Department of Defense, Department of State, and the United Nations. She
            holds a master's degree with honors in Emergency and Disaster Management.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the U.S. Navy, Wendy was one of the first two women to graduate and serve under the
            Naval Protective Services designator, directly supporting NCIS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her career has taken her across the globe, where she built long-term relationships with
            top-performing operators and service members, all focused on one mission: safeguarding
            people and communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            With nearly 50 FEMA certifications, including instructor, medical, incident command,
            CBRNE, and high-threat global security, Wendy and her extended operational network are
            built to train, consult, mentor and manage teams in high-consequence environments.
          </p>
